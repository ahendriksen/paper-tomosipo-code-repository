# Tomosipo: Fast, flexible, and convenient 3D tomography for complex scanning geometries in Python

This repository accompanies the preprint "Tomosipo: Fast, flexible, and
convenient 3D tomography for complex scanning geometries in Python". The paper
describes the tomosipo software package. This package is aimed at scientists
involved in processing data from advanced tomographic experiments with
complicated acquisition geometries. It provides facilities to create, represent,
visualize and reconstruct complex acquisition geometries.

## What is in here?

This repository contains code to create all the figures, benchmarks and contains
the full code of the running code samples throughout the paper. In addition, it
contains code to compute tomographic reconstructions that were used to compute
the reconstructions in the paper.
